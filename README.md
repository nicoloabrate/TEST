## TEST (Transport Equation Solver in Torino)
This is a suite of functions and procedures to solve 1D neutron transport equation in simple yet physically significant cases. TEST can be profitably used both as a test bench for different computational methods and a tool for approximated neutronic calculations.

Watch out: currently, TEST can solve only multi-group P1 (i.e. diffusion) equations.

## Basic features

1. Multi-layer geometries;
2. Multi-group capabilities;
3. Full compatibility with Serpent-2 output files (_res.m);
4. Criticality calculation and higher-order harmonics;
5. Perturbative chain calculations;
6. Variable density in different layers (beta version);


## Installation and pre-requisites
Since it is developed in MATLAB language, TEST needs MATLAB (version >=2016 is recommended). Future updates of TEST could make it fully compatible with OCTAVE.

To use TEST functions, just add TEST path to MATLAB folder.
