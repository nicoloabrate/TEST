Description: ## TEST (Transport Equation Solver in Torino)
        This is a suite of functions and procedures to solve 1D neutron transport equation in simple yet physically significant cases. TEST can be profitably used both as a test bench for different computational methods and a tool for approximated neutronic calculations.
        
        Watch out: currently, TEST can solve only multi-group P1 (i.e. diffusion) equations.
        
        ## Basic features
        
        1. Multi-layer geometries;
        2. Multi-group treatment of energy variable;
        3. Full compatibility with Serpent-2 output files (_res.m);
        4. Criticality calculation and higher-order harmonics;
        5. Perturbative chain calculations (GPT);
        6. Variable density in different layers (beta version);
        
        
        ## Installation and pre-requisites
        Since it is developed in MATLAB language, TEST needs MATLAB (version >=2016 is recommended). Future updates of TEST could make it fully compatible with OCTAVE.
        
        To use TEST functions, just add TEST path to MATLAB folder.
